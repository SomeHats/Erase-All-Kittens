#arca-cupboard
Arca:
	- (unless asked-mop) Good question. I mean... she is a mop. -> hobo-mop
	- (unless asked-what) Oh no... what happened? -> hobo-what
	- (unless asked-cupboard) Don't be sad Boris... there are plenty of other mops in the cupboard -> hobo-cupboard

#arca-talk
Arca:
  - (unless asked-forget) Um... I think you should try and forget about her. Maybe go on holiday? -> hobo-forget
  - (unless asked-hoover) Why don't you buy a hoover? Or take up yodelling? -> hobo-hoover
  - (unless asked-talk) Talk to your closest friends - it always helps when you're feeling sad. I used to talk to my kittens, but now they've gone... I really need to find them. Can you let me pass now? -> hobo-talk

#arca-where
Arca:
  - Oh, alright. Where do you live? -> hobo-how
